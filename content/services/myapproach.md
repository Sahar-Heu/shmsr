# My Approach to an Authentic Design

I believe that the design process should be an inspiring and nourishing experience from start to finish. My approach to branding design is to first walk the client through the definition of their brand's personality and visual identity and then create a cohesive and communicative brand board that effectively presents the brand.

A brand board is a guiding system on the brandâ€™s appearance. It works as a reference containing the elements and disciplines that were designed to present your business.

These elements can be logos, color palettes, typography, graphic elements, textures, patterns, icons and so forth. The brand board also includes the disciplines such as font principles, compositions, style of illustrations or pictures.

Using the same materials and staying consistent with the same spacing, sizing and placement across all your layouts will not only give your audience a seamless experience, but will also make your layouts (corporate materials, packaging systems, websites, etc.) complement each other effectively and coherently.
