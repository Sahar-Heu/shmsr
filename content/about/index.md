## Hello, I'm Sahar,

a creative dreamer and freelance graphic designer based in Vienna, Austria.

My specialties are bespoke design for print, digital and brand identity, although I also do styling for photoshoots and events occasionally.

I have a neat, modern style offering a fresh, authentic approach to watercolor paired with hand drawn fine line illustration. I offer my services for all kinds of design projects though, providing the necessary expertise and flexibility based on the respective project’s requirements.

The technical aspects of graphic design are just as important to me as the artistic ones, which is why I continuously learn, grow and sharpen my skills. Even though I’m usually fascinated by simplicity, I always keep an eye out for details in my designs.

I am exceptionally well organized and I genuinely care for my clients and the projects taken on.

If you would like to discuss a project, collaborate or simply say “hi”, please reach out to [studio@sahar.design](mailto:studio@sahar.design)

Thanks for stopping by, I hope you'll enjoy browsing through my [portfolio](/portfolio) or my [online shop](/shop)!
