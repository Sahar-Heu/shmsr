Hello, I'm <span class="shallou text-4xl tracking-wide font-bold">Sahar</span>, 

a creative dreamer and freelance designer based in Vienna, Austria.

My specialties are bespoke design for print, digital and brand identity, although I also do styling for photoshoots and events occasionally.

I have a neat, modern style offering a fresh, authentic approach to watercolor paired with hand drawn fine line illustration. I offer my services for all kinds of design projects though, providing the necessary expertise and flexibility based on the respective project’s requirements. 

The technical aspects of graphic design are just as important to me as the artistic ones, which is why I continuously learn, grow and sharpen my skills. Even though I’m usually fascinated by simplicity, I always keep an eye out for details in my designs.

I am exceptionally well organized and I genuinely care for my clients and the projects taken on.
